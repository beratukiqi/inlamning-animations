# School Animation Techniques Project

This project demonstrates several main animation techniques, designed as an assignment for a school course on web animations. The goal is to showcase different ways of enriching the user interface with animations, making web interactions more dynamic and engaging.

## Animation Techniques

Here's a brief overview of the animation techniques included in this project:

1. **Mouse Position Animation:**
   - A bubble on the page follow the mouse position, creating a fluid and interactive user experience that reacts to the user's movements.

2. **Magnetically Snapping Items:**
   - Call To Action buttons snap towards the mouse position when hovered, emulating a magnetic effect that attracts the cursor, adding a playful and tactile quality to the user interface.

3. **Page Transitions - Fade In/Out:**
   - Smooth fading transitions between pages provide a seamless navigation experience, reducing the cognitive load on users when content changes on the page.

4. **Hover Animation for Sidebar Toggle:**
   - The sidebar toggle features an animation that loops as the hover state, providing immediate visual feedback to the user and enhancing the usability of the navigation.
   - Had several bugs here as my list of Attractions kept getting re-renders due to mouse position re-renders. Therefore these elements are left with no hover effects for now.

5. **Modal with Staggered Animations:**
   - The modal window displays its content with staggered animations, creating a sequence that adds depth to the presentation and keeps the user engaged with the unfolding content.
   - This modal uses a backdrop that blurs the background while the modal slides and fades in from bottom.
